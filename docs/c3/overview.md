## Creating, Coding, and Computing with the BBC micro:bit and MicroCode

Welcome! We have designed this class (8 one-hour lessons) with the goal of helping you and your students (4-6th grade):
1.	Understand the parts of a computer and how they work together;
2.	Compose a set of rules to tell the computer what to do (program/code it);
3.	Create useful systems based on computers and coding.

The way we will approach this class and goals is via the lens of “physical computing”, which emphasizes the process of creatively designing tangible interactive objects or systems using programmable hardware. For this age group, it’s important to engage hands as well as minds. Furthermore, we don’t want to have students sitting at personal computers connected to the Internet, where there are lots of other distractions, not to mention the cost and overhead of bringing enough PCs into the classroom. 

How are we going to accomplish all this? Read on! 

### The BBC micro:bit

The [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org) is a small programmable computer, half the size of a credit card, developed by the BBC and partners in 2015-2016. As shown below, the front of the micro:bit has two buttons, labelled A and B.  In between the A and B buttons is a 5x5 array of 25 light-emitting diodes (LEDs, for short) that are output mechanisms. Each LED can be independently turned on or off. The micro:bit has other input and output mechanisms, shown on the backside of the micro:bit.

The BBC micro:bit is interesting for a variety of reasons: 

- **Visible**. The micro:bit makes the components of a computer visible, whereas in many modern digital devices the computing machinery is invisible, hidden away from sight, usually behind the sleek screen of a smartphone. The micro:bit gives us plenty of opportunity to discuss the different parts of computer and how they work together. 

- **Tangible**. The micro:bit is a tangible device, which means that it can be touched and manipulated. This is important for younger students, who learn best by doing.

- **Sensing**. The micro:bit comes with light, temperature, sound, and motion sensors built-in, which enables measurement of physical activities as well analysis of the natural environment. 

- **Battery-powered and embeddable**. The micro:bit can be powered by two AA batteries, so it can be incorporated (or embedded) into a variety of different projects, which will help to demonstrate the many ways in which computers are used in modern society.

- **Networked**. The micro:bit has a small radio antenna, which allows it to communicate with other nearby micro:bits.  Communication between computers over networks is how we got the Internet, world wide web, and much more delivered right into our homes. The micro:bit also has an “edge connector”, the gold pins on the bottom that allow it to be wired to other peripherals.

- **Inexpensive**. The micro:bit is relatively inexpensive, costing about $15.
